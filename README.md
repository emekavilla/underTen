## Approach
We decided to split up the tasks according to our strengths and help each other out as needed.

- Chiemeka was incharge of the databases and meals.
- Cresta was incharge of the styling and EJS files.
- Jennifer was incharge of the auth and helped with the databases.

We met up on Sunday at a meet-up to do some work. We were in constant communication this weekend about where we were at.

We used ZenHub to track our processes and we did a stand-up on Slack everyday.

## Unsolved
- Adding a meal. The function has been created, but it is not working.
- Edit a meal.
- Make the ugly buttons pretty then delete the pretty buttons that do not work.
