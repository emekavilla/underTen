## Approach
We decided to split up the tasks according to our strengths and help each other out as needed.

- Chiemeka was incharge of the databases and meals.
- Cresta was incharge of the styling and EJS files.
- Jennifer was incharge of the auth and helped with the databases.

We met up on Sunday at a meet-up to do some work. We were in constant communication this weekend about where we were at.

We used ZenHub to track our processes and we did a stand-up on Slack everyday.

## MVP
Create a full stack app that allows General Assembly students to create an account, view meals around campus for less than $10, add meals, edit meals, and delete meals.

## Unsolved
- Get it so only people who add that meal can delete it.
- Add an edit meal function.
